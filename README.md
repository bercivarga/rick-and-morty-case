## Run the development server
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Don't forget to run `npm i` before trying to run the app locally.
**NOTE: This app requires an [OpenAI](https://openai.com/api) access token for some functionality to work.**

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Project stack

The most notable tools I've used to create this app are the following:

```
- TypeScript
- Next.js
- GraphQL & Apollo Client
- Chakra UI
- OpenAI
```

Note: this is the first time I've used GraphQL, so I probably missed out on some best practices. However, I saw that it's included in the gracious tech-stack, and the Rick and Morty API also has support for it, so I figured that this would be the perfect time to experiment a little bit.
